TextEditor.mcc is a multiline string gadget for Amiga systems which offers most
of the common features you can find in a typical text editor, but embedded in a
MUI custom class. It is used by a wide range of well-known MUI based applications like
[YAM](https://github.com/jens-maus/yam) or [SimpleMail](https://github.com/sba1/simplemail)
as the main text editing gadget.

TextEditor.mcc is available for AmigaOS3, AmigaOS4, MorphOS and AROS.

* Text can be colored (limited syntax highlighting)
