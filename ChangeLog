2005-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed bug #1215342 where on hard wrapped lines a
      single character was missing at the end of the wrapped line.
    * mcc/HandleInput.c: applied a patch from Gunther Nikl which removes the
      forbidden floating point math in the wheelmouse scrolling code to due
      our shared library nature.
    * mcc/ImportHook.c: fixed the Plain ImportHook to also call AddGrow for
      every style/color item found instead of combining them. This in fact fixes
      problems with being unable to set text bold on text that was imported.
    * mcc/TextFunctions.c: replaced own anyway slightly buggy TextLength/TextFit
      functions with the OS's own TextLength/TextFit functions and adapted sources
      accordingly.

2005-06-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/ImportHook.c: reworked the MIME/Email based ImportHook to properly
      recognize the ESC sequences like the plain import hook does. This in fact
      seems to be the same behaviour than the old 68k ASM based ImportHooks had.
      Also improved the termination/recognition of the /,*,#,_ chars to make it
      possible to set soft styles on a particular text. This should also fix
      bug #1210745.
    * mcp: added keycodes for the extended keys available in AmigaOS4/MorphOS for
      example. Now keys like PAGE_UP/PAGE_DOWN are properly recognized by the
      preference pane and more intuitively configurable.

2005-06-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: if MUIA_Disabled is used on a TextEditor object, an
      existing slider was not automatically disabled as well. bug #1212811

#### v15.12 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-05-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: fixed a crash bug where the InsertHook() was
      using the passed function parameters incorrectly.
    * mcc: fixed bug #1187007 where upon using anti-aliased proportional fonts
      caused the texteditor to not correctly clear the whole cursor areas and
      therefore left some cursor "signs" back in the editor.
    * mcc/Dispatcher.c, mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed bug #1178168 where upon switching
      from another gadget to a texteditor object via the TAB key automatically
      caused that a TAB key is inserted into the text.
    * mcc/HandleInput.c: implemented wheel-mouse event recognition via the rawkey
      based NEWMOUSE standard. Now, each TextEditor.mcc object should allow to
      use an existing wheel-mouse to scroll text up/down. Previously each
      application had to implement that on its own. However, for those apps
      already having implemented it, nothing will change.

2005-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * library.c: added missing USE_UTILITYBASE define which in fact was the reason
      why the last two previous releases crashed on OS3 machines. bug #1180094

#### v15.11 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-05-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/TextFunctions.c: with help of the new debugging scheme I was
      finally able to find and fix the reason why under certain circumstances
      a texteditor.mcc gadget could end up in an endless loop if used in write
      mode. This should fix bug #1180094, #1181948.
    * misc: after having finally found a reproduceable case for bug #1180094
      and similar reports, I tight together a complete runtime debugging
      system similar to the one in YAM. It should help in finding this and
      other bugs more easily in future. This new debugging system will search
      for an "texteditor.mcc.debug" ENV variable and does accept similar
      variable content identifies like in YAM. E.g. to pull out all possible
      debug information, compile with -DDEBUG (is the default) and set
      the env variable to "@all all". However, please review the YAM
      ChangeLog for a more detailed description on the debugging scheme.

2005-04-20  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/Keybinings.c: The default keybindings array has to be
      terminated with a -1. Problem found by Georg Steger.

2005-04-17  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/Dispatcher.c: Don't add MBQ_MUI_MAXMAX when requesting maximal
      dimension in MUIM_AskMinMax but assign MUI_MAXMAX instead.

2005-04-11  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.guide: general rework - fixed typos and grammar;
      dropped the fancy V40+ formatting to make maintenance easier
      (sorry Allan :o); put the old (<15.10) changes in a separate page;
      documented the historic HD recovery... TODO: installation, arexx,
      credits and more
    * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: no longer highlights the LGPL tidbit (it
      would be unreadable against a white background otherwise, which
      would be quite common for a text editor :); fixed typos and grammar;
      reformatted to be more readable; made the usage and arexx parts
      match what the guide says; added the missing KILLLINE, TOUPPER &
      TOLOWER ARexx commands; no longer refers the user to the AUI
      Style Guide for documentation that belongs to local docs; fixed
      wrong copyright attribution (copyright for the open source code
      begins in 2005, not in 1997)
    * mcc/rev.h, mcp/rev.h: changed copyright mark "(c)" to "(C)" for
      being generally better accepted though still not legally binding
    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: likewise

2005-04-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * includes/mccheader.c: updated common MCC include file to reflect the
      latest changes done in the nlist.mcc project.
    * includes/mccclass_68k: replaced the assembler based OS4/68k stub by an
      easier manageable C-based variant.
	 
2005-04-10  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/library.c: Request rexxsyslib.library V36 (KS 3.1) instead of V38.

#### v15.10 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-04-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * all: last preparations for the 15.10 release. bumped version date and
      such.

2005-04-08  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/SpellChecker.c: Now compiles without OS4 headers too.
    * mcc/TextEditor-Test.c: Fixed MorphOS build.
    * includes/SDI_hook.h: Changed MorphOS hooks to use HookEntry stub.

2005-04-08  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * TODO: Added two more entries (italic letter problem, tabs)

2005-04-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: fixed incorrectly formatted about text.
    * mcp: added missing ENTRY() calls to the Dispatchers which are required
      by the MorphOS build. However, this required to put the Create/Delete
      of our subclasses into Dispatcher.c, but now the mcp should hopefully
      work on MorphOS as well.

2005-04-07  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: fixed typos, corrected grammar, reformatted
      to make it a bit more readable and adapted to the new state of
      affairs (LGPL)

2005-04-07  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/SpellChecker.c: Reimplemented the search path feature also
      for systems not having a recent workbench.library. Code is mainly
      untested but the core is taken from YAM with permission from
      Jens Langner. So TextEditor-mcc is still LGPL ;)
      Note that this code is not included within the OS4 compile so
      this feature requires at least version 44 of workbench.library
      here. But this is a tautology.
    * mcc: No longer uses static hook declarations within functions,
      because same code of a mcc can be executed by several tasks!
    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: Warn about unpredictable results of
      forbidden placement of some escape sequences for the plain import
      hook.

2005-04-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>
 
    * mcc: fixed OS3 build as well and removed all remaining compiler
      warnings.
    * mcc/Dispatcher.c: fixed recently broken OS4 build due to latest
      MorphOS changes.

2005-04-06  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc: Removed compiler warnings for MorphOS build.

2005-04-06  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/ImportHook.c: Changed behaviour of FindEOL() not to return NULL
      if the text only consits of a 0 byte. This fixed bug #1177619. 

2005-04-05  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Clipboard handling for copy/paste was totaly broken (don't
      confuse clipboard.device with console.device ;) ). Now only one 
      pointer is used within the instance data for the clipboard io
      request.
    * mcc: Reimplemented Workbench path search support when starting shell
      commands (e.g. for the spell checkers). This however requires at
      least version 44 of workbench.library (coming with OS3.5)
    * mcc: Finished complete reimplementation of the import hooks. Because
      the nature of a reimplementation, the behaviour of the new functions
      might be different and even buggy. Exporting also works in the
      meantime.

2005-04-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/ImportText.c: fixed bug where an empty MUIA_TextEditor_Contents
      string didn't clear the texteditor area.
    * mcc: removed the last bunch of compiler warnings and made the
      custom class compile with -DDEBUG disabled.

2005-04-01  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Now clears the area before the text near the cursor is
      redrawn. Fixes bug #1172355 aka "anti alias bug". This is no
      april fool ;)
    * mcc: Started to reimplement all of the import and export hooks
      which were 68k asm before

2005-03-31  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Fixed buffer overflow which happened if the font name was 
      longer than 27 chars.
    * all: Enforce amiga align for the keybinding structure because
      this is exported to the settings file and has to be compatible
      with the 68k version.

2005-03-31  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * all: Source cleanup and minor OS3 makefile changes.

2005-03-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp: modified preferences sources to use flexcat to generate
      the locale.c,h files out of the new TextEditor_mcp.cd and C_?.sd
      files instead of having a static locale interface.

2005-03-31  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd: added

2005-03-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * initial LGPL release published at sf.net
