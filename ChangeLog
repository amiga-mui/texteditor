    * mcc: Finished complete reimplementation of the import hooks. Because
      the nature of a reimplementation, the behaviour of the new functions
      might be different and even buggy. Exporting also works in the
      meantime.

2005-04-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/ImportText.c: fixed bug where an empty MUIA_TextEditor_Contents
      string didn't clear the texteditor area.
    * mcc: removed the last bunch of compiler warnings and made the
      custom class compile with -DDEBUG disabled.

2005-04-01  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Now clears the area before the text near the cursor is
      redrawn. Fixes bug #1172355 aka "anti alias bug". This is no
      april fool ;)
    * mcc: Started to reimplement all of the import and export hooks
      which were 68k asm before

2005-03-31  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Fixed buffer overflow which happened if the font name was 
      longer than 27 chars.
    * all: Enforce amiga align for the keybinding structure because
      this is exported to the settings file and has to be compatible
      with the 68k version.

2005-03-31  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * all: Source cleanup and minor OS3 makefile changes.

2005-03-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp: modified preferences sources to use flexcat to generate
      the locale.c,h files out of the new TextEditor_mcp.cd and C_?.sd
      files instead of having a static locale interface.

2005-03-31  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd: added

2005-03-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * initial LGPL release published at sf.net
